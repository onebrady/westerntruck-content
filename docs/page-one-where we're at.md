## 3 Most Critical Technical SEO Improvements (with Actual Issues)

### 1. Redirect & Canonical Inconsistencies
- **Current Problem:**  
  Multiple URLs like `/inventory?sort=price` set the canonical tag to the full parameterized URL rather than the clean base (`/inventory`). Several product/archive pages have canonical tags pointing at non-preferred variants or www/non-www mixes.
- **Your File Evidence:**  
  Audit rows show mixed canonical tags and 301 chains for inventory and archive URLs.
- **Solution:**  
  Force all canonicals to clean, non-parameter base URLs (e.g., `/inventory`). Standardize to only HTTPS non-www. Ensure all chains are single-step to canonical version only.

---

### 2. Duplicate/Thin Inventory Content
- **Current Problem:**  
  100+ inventory URLs are close duplicates or only differ by minor SKU fields, creating thin pages and index bloat.
- **Your File Evidence:**  
  [website audit.xlsx] and crawl depth data show hundreds of SKU URLs, many with <30 unique pageviews and boilerplate descriptions.
- **Solution:**  
  Merge or prune near-duplicate listings, add unique content where needed, and use canonical tags correctly for true variant listings. Archive or noindex obsolete stock.

---

### 3. Schema Markup Coverage Gaps
- **Current Problem:**  
  While almost all inventory pages contain Product schema, main product-family landing pages and service pages lack extended schema for Breadcrumb, FAQ, and Service/LocalBusiness.
- **Your File Evidence:**  
  Schema.org fields “0” or “partial” in [website audit.xlsx] for category/service/guide pages.
- **Solution:**  
  Add Breadcrumb, FAQPage, and LocalBusiness schema to all main landing, guide, and service pages. Implement via JSON-LD for future flexibility.

**Key Insights**
- **Organic Search** delivers the highest volume of key events (285) and high average engagement, anchoring long-term site health.
- Referral and Paid Search have the highest event rates but lower total event count.
- Social channels provide reach, but not as many conversions or high-value actions.

**(Source: GA4 Pages & Screens Report)**

### **Top Traffic Pages (by Views & Users)**

| Page Path                    | Views  | Active Users | Avg. Engagement Time (s) | Key Events | Bounce Rate |
|------------------------------|--------|-------------|--------------------------|------------|------------|
| /                            | 13,666 | 8,843       | 13.6                     | 67         | 51.1%      |

| /inventory                   | 4,474  | 2,355       | 77.3                     | 18         | 18.2%      |
| /side-dumps                  | 2,174  | 1,389       | 46.9                     | 8          | 21.5%      |
| /parts                       | 1,417  | 931         | 74.1                     | 10         | 26.8%      |

**Top Performing by Key Events**
- **/contact-us**: 200 key events (outperforming most others; should be optimized further)
- **/inventory**: 18 key events (purchase/rental funnel; high engagement, low bounce)

### **Pages Needing Improvement**
_(Low conversion or poor engagement relative to traffic)_
- **/lowboy-trailers** (high traffic, high bounce, low key events): Lower than expected conversions; could improve with stronger CTAs, more content depth, and use-case examples.
- **/bottom-dumps** (lots of traffic, high bounce, few key events): Add decision guides, visual comparisons, more local calls-to-action.
- **/inventory/[product-id]**: Many SKU pages exist but with low views per page and limited event activity; consider consolidation and richer descriptions.

## 3. Traffic & Performance by Device
**(Source: GA4 Device Tech Details)**

| Device    | Active Users | Engaged Sessions | Engagement Rate | Avg. Engagement Time (s) | Key Events | Event Rate |
|-----------|-------------|------------------|-----------------|--------------------------|------------|-----------|
| **Mobile**   | 31,067      | 14,051           | 37.0%           | 33.7                     | 448        | 1.44%     |
| Desktop  | 10,341      | 9,040            | 59.4%           | 84.7                     | 277        | 2.68%     |
| Tablet   | 1,437       | 387              | 24.8%           | 21.4                     | 4          | 0.28%     |

**Key Device KPIs**
- **Mobile**: 73% of all active users, but lower engagement/longer sessions and slightly lower conversion rate than desktop.
- **Desktop**: Drives higher engagement and conversion per user, though only 24% of users.
- **Implication**: Prioritize **mobile UX optimization** (speed, forms, CTAs) to capture more leads and improve event conversion rates, but do not neglect desktop since those are higher engagement/value users.

## 4. Critical Traffic, Conversion & Engagement KPIs to Monitor

### Core Benchmarks (Feb–Jul 2025)
- **Organic Traffic**: 9,045 users (6 months)
- **Organic Conversion (Key Event) Rate**: 1.71% (best-in-class benchmark: 2–4%)
- **Top Traffic Pages**: Homepage, /lowboy-trailers, /bottom-dumps, /inventory, /side-dumps, /parts
- **Most Engaged Funnels**: /inventory and /contact-us perform well for key events, engagement, and low bounce
- **Device Mix**: Mobile-heavy ecosystem; critical KPI for ongoing improvement is **Mobile Event Rate** (currently about 1.4%)
- **Weak Pages**: Category pages (e.g., /lowboy-trailers) underperform on key events despite high traffic

---

## 5. Things to Focus On Next

- **Increase event rates and conversions on high-traffic, high-bounce pages** (mainly /lowboy-trailers, /bottom-dumps).
  - Add decision guides, comparison tools, and in-content CTAs.
- **Consolidate or enhance underperforming product and inventory detail pages** (many with isolated SKU/low sessions).
- **Mobile optimization** remains crucial – improve UX, forms, load speed, and in-content linking.
- **Enhance tracking**: Ensure every key funnel step and micro-conversion is tracked across both mobile and desktop versions.

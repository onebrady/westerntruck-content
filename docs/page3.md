## Best Practices for Ongoing SEO & Content Measurement

### 1. Centralized Reporting Dashboard

- **Setup:**  
  Use a unified dashboard (Looker Studio, Power BI, or Data Studio) pulling Google Analytics 4 (GA4), Google Search Console, and SEMrush data.
- **Benefits:**  
  - “Single source of truth” for all KPIs and trendlines
  - Real-time exec visibility and drill-down filtering
  - Manual and automated reporting for stakeholders

### 2. Core Metrics & Views to Set Up

**(Recommend separate “tiles” for each metric in dashboard UI)**
- **Organic Traffic:** Monthly, weekly, and YoY change
- **Keyword Rankings:** Top 3/10/20 keyword counts and focus on target “money” keywords
- **Engagement Rate, Bounce Rate, & Average Session Length**
- **Conversions from Organic:** Leads/quotes/forms/calls tied to SEO visitors only
- **Conversion Rate by Landing Page:** Track pages that drive best performance
- **Branded vs. Non-Branded Traffic:** To measure brand lift vs. new audience reach
- **Content Cluster/Landing Page Performance:** Attribution by content type or category

**Chart.js Recommendations:**
- **Line or Area Chart:** Progress of organic traffic and conversions over time (e.g., MoM for last 6–12 months)
- **Stacked Bar or Pie Chart:** Breakdown of conversions by landing page, or branded vs. non-branded segment
- **Table with Sparklines:** Top 10 performing keywords, their position, and trend

### 3. SEMrush & GA4 – How to Use Each Tool

#### **Google Analytics 4**
- **Track:**  
  - Session source/medium (organic)
  - Landing page performance
  - Event/conversion completions (must be tagged as “Key Events” in GA4)
  - Audience: new vs. returning, geo, device
- **Custom Insights:**  
  - Content groups by topic/category
  - Assisted conversions attributed to content clusters
  - Funnel analysis: from landing to conversion

#### **Google Search Console**
- **Track:**  
  - Total clicks, impressions, CTR, average position (filtered to www.westerntruck.com)
  - Query and page-level performance
- **Identify:**  
  - High-impression, low-CTR pages for quick wins (metadata optimizations)
  - Rising search queries and featured snippet wins

#### **SEMrush**
- **Track:**  
  - Overall keyword visibility score vs. competitors
  - Top 3/10/20 keyword count over time
  - Backlink profile growth
  - Keyword gap/opportunities for new topic coverage

### 4. Success Evaluation & Goal Review

- **Review cadence:**  
  - Monthly: Evaluate traffic, rankings, and conversions growth; check against 6-month targets
  - Quarterly: Audit technical fixes, content cluster performance, and competitor changes
  - Annually: Full-blown ROI/impact analysis and new yearly targets

- **Adjust Plan If:**  
  - KPIs fall flat (diagnose funnel leaks, find technical/content gaps)
  - New search trends or product offers emerge
  - High-value new content opportunities or PPC insights appear

   Connect GA4, GSC, and SEMrush; schedule weekly and monthly syncs.
2. **Executive Dashboard:**
